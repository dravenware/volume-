        <p class="text-left"><b>Unreal Office Scene</b><br>
        An office scene created in U3D is a showing of what you can make with basically nothing interesting. All assets used came either with U3D or are from the offical Starter Assets Kit.</p>
        <div class="zoom">
                <img src="img/Capture1.PNG">
        </div>
        <p class="text-left">As some props used in this scene aren't actually a part of the kit, combining props with each other is one way to workaround that issue. Example:</p>
        <div class="zoom">
                <img src="img/Capture2.PNG">
        </div>
        <p class="text-left">The glass pannels shown <i>do</i> come with the Starter Kit but they where obviously made for windows, not as a means of seperatng rooms. So, to make sure the scene still makes scense, you'd add something small as a mounting device. We'll be using a corner frame for that.</p>
        <div class="zoom">
                <img src="img/Capture3.PNG">
        </div>
        <h4 class="text-left"><i>Yeah, props and windows are cool an stuff but what about those silver ball things?</i></h4><p class="text-left">Good question. Those are Cube Maps, even though they look like spheres. Though, that being said, Cube Maps identify their function based off what editor sprite they use. As what a Cube Map is, its basically a component that finds reflections and draws them to reflective surfaces.</p>
        <h6 class="text-left"><b>Sphere Reflection Capture</b></h6>
        <p class="text-left">These are used for a more smooth, flexible reflection capture. These can be used to create more fluid reflection transitions from individual captures, the example below displays this by making the transition blend with the background. In practice, multiple reflections can layer each other without a straight line cutting through.</p>

        <h6 class="text-left"><b>Cube Reflection Capture</b></h6>
        <p class="text-left">These are used mainly for boxy interiors or spaces with the same shape as the capture. However, entities which are closer to the capture point will be made to look much, much larger in the reflection itself. This is because all reflections are being captured from the exact distance they are from the capture point. The main idea of the Box Capture is to create a better presepective-like sense of depth.</p>
